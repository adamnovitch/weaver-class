### Sword Training
As a Weaver, you have trained with various swords. At first level you gain proficiency in longswords, rapiers, scimitars, and shortswords.

### Weapon Defense
At 1st level, while you are holding a weapon with the Finesse or Versatile property, you get a +1 bonus to your AC.

### Cantrips
At 1st level, choose 2 Cantrips from the Weaver spell list. You know these two Cantrips and can cast them at will.

### Spellcasting
Starting at 2nd level, your training and connection to the Weave allows you to perform feats and cast spells. As a weaver, your knowledge of the weave allows you to bypass the need for material spell components or an arcane focus. However for spell components that have a gold value or consumed materials, you still require the material components. You can cast spells by expending spell slots, and your number of spell slots is determined in the class table. They are regained after a long rest.

Your spellcasting may require you to make a spell attack or force your target(s) to make a saving throw. Wisdom is your ability for this feature:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

When you level up, you can learn a new spell, up to the spell level denoted in the class table, and can forget one spell you already know and learn a new one.

### Weave Powers
You gain additional abilities as you level up called Weave Powers. Your number of weave powers known is determined in the class table.  You can have a number of Weave powers up to the number denoted in the class table, and can change which powers you have when you level up.

### Path Selection
At 3rd level you choose your Path: Guardian, Sentinel, or Sage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
At 5th level, you can make 2 attacks with your attack action.

### Magical Blast
At 7th level, you can create a blast of magical energy as an action. This blast has a range of 30 feet. Roll a ranged spell attack and add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus. You do not have disadvantage on the attack roll if an enemy is within 5 feet. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 force damage and must make a strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet. You can spend a maximum of 2 Spell Points, and for each point spent, the damage increases by 1d6. The maximum spell points you can spend on this ability increases to 4 at level 11, and 6 at level 17. The distance this attack pushes increases to 10 feet at level 11 and 15 feet at level 17.

### Grasp of the Weave
At level 20, as a bonus action you can draw power from the weave to enhance your abilities further than before. Any concentration you have on other spell is broken and you cannot cast spells requiring concentration. While using this ability you can't be surprised, you have resistance to all damage, and you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. In addition, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. This lasts for one minute. It does not require concentration, but you need to make a concentration check to maintain it. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after a long rest.

## Weaver Paths

### Path of the Guardian
#### Fighter Training
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Heavy Armor. You may also choose a fighting style from the following:
- Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
- Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
- Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
- Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Empowered Strikes
At 6th level, you can channel raw magical energy into your attacks. When you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, you can use this ability to do additional force damage equal to 1d12 + your wisdom modifier. The weapon damage for this attack is considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance to non-magical piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your wisdom modifier and regain all uses during a short or long rest.

#### Spellstrike
Beginning at 10th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can use your bonus action to make one weapon attack.

#### Supreme Fortitude
At 14th level you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

#### Flurry attack
At 18th level you can make 3 attacks with your attack action.

### Path of the Sage
#### Extra Cantrips
At 3rd level, you learn a 3rd Cantrip from the Weaver spell list. You also learn 1 Cantrip from any spell list. This cantrip counts as a Weaver spell and uses your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for attack or DC.

#### Weave Recovery
At 6th level, when you complete short rest, you regain 1 spell slot of the highest spell slot you can use or split between lower level spell slots. For example, if you are a 5th level Weaver, you can recover a 2nd level slot or two 1st level slots.

Some of your abilities will require your target to make a saving throw. The DC may be determined by your STR or DEX instead of WIS, whichever ability you use to make the weapon attack.

#### Combat Prowess
At 3rd level, you learn to use your attacks to do more than just damage the enemy. Once per round when you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, you can attempt to disarm that enemy or knock that enemy prone. The enemy must make Strength saving throw against your Strength or Dexterity, whichever you used to attack. On a failure, that enemy is either disarmed or is knocked prone. If you attempt to disarm an enemy that is holding a weapon with 2 hands, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses after a short or long rest.

#### Blinding and Thunderous Cantrips
At 6th level, you learn the Thunderclap and Word of Radiance cantrips. They are treated as Weaver spells and use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for the DC. When you use these cantrips, and at least one creature fails the saving throw, you can blind (Word of Radiance) or deafen (thunderclap) the creature(s) for 1 round. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses after a short or long rest.
