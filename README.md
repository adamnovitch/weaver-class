- *(a)* a Martial Melee Weapon or *(b)* a simple melee weapon
- Leather Armor
- *(a)* a Scholar's Pack or *(b)* an Explorer's Pack

### Sword Training
As a Weaver, you have trained with various swords. At first level you gain proficiency in longswords, rapiers, scimitars, and shortswords.

### Weapon Defense
At 1st level, while you are holding a weapon with the Finesse or Versatile property, you get a +1 bonus to your AC.

### Cantrips
At 1st level, choose 2 Cantrips from the Weaver spell list. You know these two Cantrips and can cast them at will.

### Spellcasting and Spell Points
Starting at 2nd level, your training and connection to the Weave allows you to perform feats and cast spells. As a weaver, your grasp of the weave allows you to bypass the need for material spell components or an arcane focus. However for spell components that have a gold value or consumed materials, you still require the material components. Your access to the Weave is measured in Spell Points. Your number of Spell Points are determined in the class table. They are regained after a long rest.

Your spellcasting may require you to make a spell attack or force your target(s) to make a saving throw. Wisdom is your ability for this feature:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

When casting spells, you use spell points instead of spell slots. Refer to the following table to determine the spell point equivalent of a spell's level:

| Spell Level | Spell Points |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
|           1 |            2 |
|           2 |            3 |
|           3 |            5 |
|           4 |            6 |
|           5 |            7 |
|           6 |            9 |

You also get weave powers, which require you to use spell points but are not considered spels. When you level up, you can learn a new spell, up to the spell level denoted in the class table, and can forget one spell you already know and learn a new one. You can have a number of Weave powers up to the number denoted in the class table, and can change which powers you have when you finish a long rest. Unless otherwise noted, all weave powers use your action while in combat.

### Path Selection
At 3rd level you choose your Path: Guardian, Sentinel, or Sage. Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
At 5th level, you can make 2 attacks with your attack action.

### Force Blast
At 7th level, you can create a invisible blast of magical energy as an action. This blast has a range of 60 feet, and does 2d6 force damage. Roll a ranged spell attack and add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target must make a strength saving throw or be pushed back 5 feet. You can spend a maximum of 2 Spell Points, and for each point spent, the damage increases by 1d6 and you can push the enemy back an additional 5 feet. You do not have disadvantage if an enemy is within 5 feet. The maximum Spell points you can spend on this ability increases to 4 at level 11, and 6 at level 15. 

### Grasp of the Weave
At level 20, as a bonus action you can draw power from the weave to enhance your abilities further than before. Any concentration you have on other spell is broken and you cannot cast spells requiring concentration. While using this ability you can't be surprised, you have resistance to all damage, and you have advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. In addition, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. This lasts for one minute. It does not require concentration, but you need to make a concentration check to maintain it. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until after a long rest.

## Weaver Paths

### Path of the Guardian
#### Fighter Training
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Heavy Armor. You may also choose a fighting style from the following:
- Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
- Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
- Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
- Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

#### Empowered Strikes
At 6th level, you can use a bonus action before you attack to spend 1 spell point. Your weapon attacks this turn are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance, and deal extra damage equal to your wisdom modifier (minimum 1).
#### Spellstrike
Beginning at 10th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you can use your bonus action to make one weapon attack.
#### Supreme Fortitude
At 14th level you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.
#### Flurry attack
At 18th level you can make 3 attacks with your attack action.

### Path of the Sage
### Extra Cantrips
At 3rd level, you learn a 3rd Cantrip from the Weaver spell list. You also learn 1 Cantrip from any spell list. This cantrip counts as a Weaver spell and uses your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for attack or DC.
### Weave Recovery
At 6th level, when you complete short rest, you regain Weave points equal to your Wisdom modifier.
#### Empowered Casting
At 10th level you add your Widom modifier to the damage of any spell or weave power you use.
#### Force of Will
At 14th level, you gain proficiency in either Intelligence or Charisma saving throws. You also learn Counterspell. It is considered a Weaver spell and uses your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability.
### Enhanced Casting
At level 18, all spells you cast are treated as being cast 1 level higher for the purpose of extra damage dice or multiple targets.

### Path of the Sentinel
Some of your abilities will require your target to make a saving throw. The DC may be determined by your STR or DEX instead of WIS, whichever ability you use to make the weapon attack.
#### Combat Prowess
At 3rd level, when you hit an enemy with a weapon attack, you can expend 1 Spell Point to force that enemy to make a Strength saving throw, basing the DC off of your STR or DEX. On a failure, that enemy is either disarmed or is knocked prone. If you attempt to disarm an enemy that is holding a weapon with 2 hands, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can only use this ability once per round.
#### Enhanced Comat Tricks
At 6th level, when you successfully knock a creature prone using Combat Prowess, you can spend an additional spell point to slam them into the ground, inflicting an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage. This increases to 2d6 at level 11 and 3d6 at level 17.  
Additionally, when you take the attack action you can spend 2 spell points to use one of the following abilities:
- You can teleport up to half your movement speed.
- You can turn invisible until the beginning of your next turn. This effect ends if you cast a spell or make an attack.
#### Blinding and Thunderous Cantrips
At 10th level, you learn the Thunderclap and Word of Radiance cantrips. They are treated as Weaver spells and use your Wisdom as your spellcasting ability for the DC. You can spend 2 spell points when you cast either of these spells, and if you do, and a creature fails the saving throw, they become blinded (Word of Radiance) or deafened (thunderclap) for 1 round.
#### Evasiveness
At 14th level You gain proficiency in Dexterity saves.
#### Paralyzing Strike
At 18th level, when you hit an enemy with a weapon attack you can spend 7 Spell Points to force the enemy to make a CON save against either your STR, DEX, or WIS, or be paralyzed for 1 round.
