Date: 6/30/18
Character: Owrwyn_3
Weapons Used: Dagger, Longsword, Grapple
Spells used: Thunderwave
Powers used: None
Perceived Encounter Difficulty: Easy
Party Makeup:
 - Fighter (Monster Hunter)
 - Blood Hunter (Unknown Details)
 - Warlock (Tome, patron unknown)
 - Bard (College Unknown)
Enemies:
 - Xvart x12
 - Xvart Warlock of Raxivort x1
 - Tiefling NPC thieves, levels 2 and 4 
Skills:
 - Information gathering
 - Perception checks
 - Insight checks
Conclusion:
 Owryn's main contribution to the party by taking care of most of the Xvarts in
 a single Thunderwave. Inconclusive, as any arcane caster could have used an AOE
 spell similarly, DC was 12, enemies had low CON.
Other Notes:
 First time DM.

Date: 7/5/18
Character: Owrwyn_3
Weapons Used: Longsword, Dagger
Spells used: Mage Hand, Magic Weapon
Powers used: None
Perceived Encounter Difficulty: Easy
Party Makeup:
 - Rogue (Mastermind)
 - Blood Hunter (Unknown Details)
 - Monk (Kensei)
Enemies:
 - A lot of Kruthiks
Skills:
 - Perception checks
 - Stealth Checks
 - Strength Check
Conclusion:
 - Did mostly melee this time. Regular melee was effective. Saber Defense was of
   little help, but the issue is the base AC of 14. Will see how it works with
   better armor.
Other Notes:
 - Had an NPC with us so not as difficult.
