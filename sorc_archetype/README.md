## Martial Proficiencies
You gain proficiency in light and medium armor, simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars, rapiers, and longswords. Additionally you can use a weapon as an arcane focus.

## Enhanced Vitality
When you take your 1st level in this class you gain an extra 1 hp, and you gain 1 additional HP every time you level up in this class.

## Unarmored Defense
When calculating your AC, you can have your AC become 10 + Your Dexterity Modifier + Your Charisma Modifier.

## Extra Spells
Starting at 1st level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, shown in the table below. These spells count as sorcerer spells you know, but don't count against the number of sorceror spells you know. When you take levels in this class you cannot forget these spells.

| Sorcerer Level | Spells            |
|:--------------:|:------------------|
| 1st            | Zephyr Strike     |
| 3rd            | Magic Weapon      |
| 5th            | Zephyr Strike     |
| 7th            | Divination        |
| 9th            | Steel Wind Strike |

## Extra Attack
At 6th level you can attack twice when you take the attack action.

## Staggering Attack
At 14th level, you can channel the Weave into your attacks to do additional damage. When you hit with a weapon attack, you can use your bonus action to spend 2 sorcery points and inflict extra damage equal to 2d12 + your charisma modifier and foce the target to make a saving throw. If the target fails they are stunned until the end of your next turn.

## Break Connection
At 18th level your connection to the Weave is so full you can even sever others' connections to it for a short time. As an action you can spend 5 sorcery points and make a contested ability check against a creature within 30 feet. You roll a Charisma check and the target rolls their spellcasting or psionic ability. If you win the check, the target cannot use spells, spell-like abilities, or psionics for 1 minute and the target's concentration is broken.
