- *(a)* a Martial Melee Weapon or *(b)* any simple melee weapon
- Leather Armor

### Sword Training
As a Weaver, you have trained with various swords. At first level you gain proficiency in shortswords, scimitars, and longswords.

### Saber Defense
At 1st level, while you are holding a Dagger, Scimitar, Shortsword, or Longsword, you get a +1 to your AC.

### Cantrips
At 1st level, choose 2 Cantrips from the Weaver spell list. You know these two Cantrips and can cast them at will.

### Spellcasting and Spell Points
Starting at 2nd level, your training and connection to the Weave allows you to perform feats and cast spells. Your access to the Weave is measured in Spell Points. Your number of Spell Points are determined in the class table. They are regained after a long rest.

Your spellcasting may require you to make a spell attack or force your target(s) to make a saving throw. Wisdom is your ability for this feature:

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

When casting spells, you use spell points instead of spell slots. Refer to the following table to determine the spell point equivalent of a spell's level:

| Spell Level | Spell Points |
|:-----------:|:------------:|
|           1 |            2 |
|           2 |            3 |
|           3 |            5 |
|           4 |            6 |
|           5 |            7 |
|           6 |            9 |

You also get weave powers, which cost spell points but are not considered spellcasting. When you level up, you can learn a new spell, up to the spell level denoted in the class table, and can forget one spell you already know and learn a new one. You can have a number of Weave powers up to the number denoted in the class table, and can change which powers you have when you finish a long rest. You cannot select Weaver Powers whose point cost is more than half your level.

### Path Selection
At 3nd level you choose your Path: Guardian, Sentinel, or Sage. Your choice grants you features at 3nd, 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack
At 5th level, you can make 2 attacks with your attack action.

### Force Blast
At 7th level, you can create a invisible blast of magical energy as a bonus action. This blast has a range of 60 feet, and does 2d6 force damage. Roll a ranged spell attack and add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target must make a strength saving throw of be pushed back 5 feet. You can spend a maximum of 2 Spell Points, and for each point spent, the damage increases by 1d6 and you can push the enemy back an additional 5 feet. You do not have disadvantage if an enemy is within 5 feet.
